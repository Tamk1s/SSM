FEEDBACK:
*Flip BNC V & H sync positions (RGBHV not RGBVH)

*Better footprints:
**BNC jacks
**IDC34 jack
**RCA Jacks
**Power switch
**Power Jack

*Make BNC connectors have a min c2c distance of 0.75"-1"

2 new models:
*DX Basic
*DX Premium
Both like SSM and SSMX models, but terinate with IDC14 headers/cables, which goto other adapter suboards for different outputs. (IDC34, DB25, 8-pin Multi Input)
Research the pinouts for typical PVM DB-25 and goofball Profeel 8-pin

*Adjust width of SSMX to make it still fit in Stackable Walmart crayon box
