FEEDBACK:
*Flip BNC V & H sync positions (RGBHV not RGBVH)

*WARNING! SSMX model has missing trace on the power circuit for one of the power rails! FIX THIS
*SSMX Eagle PCB art is messed up. Copy logo from SSM to fix it.

*Better footprints:
**BNC jacks
**IDC34 jack
**RCA Jacks
**Power switch
**Power Jack

*Make BNC connectors have a min c2c distance of 0.75"-1"
*Replace Bus Switch ICs (now obsoleted) with newer replacment, refactor board. (Has more inputs than older, additional input unused)

2 new models:
*DX Basic
*DX Premium
Both like SSM and SSMX models, but terminate with IDC14 headers/cables, which goto other adapter daughterboards for different outputs. (IDC34, DB25, 8-pin Multi Input)
Research the pinouts for typical PVM DB-25 and goofball Profeel 8-pin

*Adjust width of SSMX to make it still fit in Stackable Walmart crayon box https://www.walmart.com/ip/Advantus-Corp-Stackable-Crayon-Box/32962001
OR better yet!
*Michael's metal box:

BOM:
*Crayon box
*Foam block 
*Cheap rubber feet
*6"x9" padded
